Conference this past March she begins with the recognition that there is no such thing as a perfect family. It's up to us to be the difference that can make our families better. Tara urges us to go beyond the standards our families have provided and challenges us to push down new paths. What if, in doing so, we won't just create new opportunities for ourselves, we'll also uncover ways to create new opportunities for our families that may not have otherwise existed? The life you have doesn't mean it's the life you've been given. Sometimes we can make the biggest impact on the world by starting with our family. Tara's talk defines generation changers and provides a path of five steps you can take to set the stage for those who come after you. What if you can become a family generation changer? What changes are you going to make to set a new course for the future of your family? A proactive, self-help junkie and advisor in the Student Success Center at Missouri S&T where she graduated with her BS and MS in Technical Communication, Tara is the creator of Remarkable180 that encourages people to stop existing and start living by making changes in their life.

       "[(\"Headline: Federal Judge Suspends New York City's Vaccine Mandate For Teachers\\nDate: 2021-09-25\\nAuthor: Michael Hill, AP\\nSummary: But the district is confident that it will prevail.\\nArticle: New York City schools have been temporarily blocked from enforcing a vaccine mandate for its teachers and other workers by a federal appeals judge just days before it was to take effect. Workers in the nation’s largest school system were to be required to show vaccination proof starting Monday. But late Friday, a judge for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a temporary injunction sought by a group of teachers and referred the case to a three-judge panel an an expedited basis. Department of Education spokesperson Danielle Filson said that officials are seeking a speedy resolution and that the circuit court has the motion on its calendar for Wednesday. “We’re confident our vaccine mandate will continue to be upheld once all the facts have been presented, because that is the level of protection our students and staff deserve,” Filson said in an email. The New York Postreportedthat the department sent an email to principals Saturday morning saying they “should continue to prepare for the possibility that the vaccine mandate will go into effect later in the week.” Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in August that about 148,000 school employees would have to get at least a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccination by Sept. 27. The policy covers teachers, along with other staffers, such as custodians and cafeteria workers. It’s the first no-test-option vaccination mandate for a broad group of city workers in the nation’s most populous city. And it mirrors a similar statewide mandate for hospital and nursing home workers set to go into effect Monday. As of Friday, 82% of department employees have been vaccinated, including 88% of teachers. Even though most school workers have been vaccinated, unions representing New York City principals and teachers warned that could still leave the 1 million-student school system short of as many as 10,000 teachers, along with other staffers. De Blasio has resisted calls to delay the mandate, insisting the city was ready. “We’ve been planning all along. We have a lot of substitutes ready,” the Democrat said in a radio interview on Friday. “A lot is going to happen between now and Monday but beyond that, we are ready, even to the tune of, if we need thousands, we have thousands.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

       " (\"Headline: Joe Biden’s ‘Vaccine Mandate’ Has An Alternative: Weekly Tests\\nDate: 2021-12-04\\nAuthor: Arthur Delaney, Dave Jamieson, and Igor Bobic\\nSummary: But the testing option won't be fun, and maybe that's the idea.\\nArticle: WASHINGTON ― A faction of congressional Republicans threatened to shut down the government this week over what they call President Joe Biden’s “vaccine mandate.” The rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration would not require employers to take action against unvaccinated workers so long as they’re willing to be tested weekly for COVID-19 ― but Republicans have ignored that part of the regulation. “When you’re unwilling to describe something accurately, it betrays a weakness in your position,” Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said on the Senate floor Thursday evening. “It’s not a vaccine mandate. It is a vaccine-or-testing mandate.” Indeed, the OSHA rule, which istied up in courtand hasn’t taken effect, does not require people to get shots. It requires large employers to implement programs in which workerswho work indoorseither get vaccinated or wear a mask and undergo weekly testing for COVID-19. Employers, if they choose, can mandate that their workers get the jab(as many employers already do). But OSHA’s rule allows every employer the leeway to test. Kaine is not the only supporter of the rule annoyed by Republicans’ lack of nuance. David Michaels, who ran OSHA under former President Barack Obama, said that employers don’t have to force a vaccine on anyone — they just have to keep infected workers out of the workplace. “Misrepresenting OSHA’s rule is a cynical tactic by Republican politicians and anti-vaxxers who seem to want to prolong the pandemic and the misery it has brought, in order to hurt the Biden Administration,” Michaels said in an email. Testing is anoptionunder the rule, but it would probably be an annoying one — and that may be the idea. In itspreambleto the rule’s text, OSHA calls vaccination “the most effective and efficient control available” to prevent transmission of the virus. The logistical and financial hurdles to weekly tests make vaccination more attractive. OSHA’s rule would not force employers to foot the bill for testing, raising questions about how the cost would be covered. Federal law requires insurers to cover the cost of COVID-19 tests, but not for tests done as part of workplace screening. The Biden administration announced Thursday that insurers will have to reimburse the cost of over-the-counter tests. Such tests are acceptable under the OSHA rule if they are Food and Drug Administration-approved, but it’s not clear if insurers will have to reimburse for tests done for the sake of OSHA compliance. Even if they are covered, having tohaggle with one’s insurance companywould be a headache. Another headache: “Home” tests not done under the supervision of a manager would have to be observed by a “telehealth proctor.” Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the Biden administration should clarify if regular over-the-counter tests for work must be reimbursed. But she also said there is a good public health reason for the weekly testing regime to be somewhat obnoxious. “Ingeneral, we need to make vaccination an easy and convenient choice, so having employees be required to mask and test is the right thing to do for public health reasons,” Wen said in an interview. “It adds an additional incentive for vaccination.” Republicans have omitted the testing option from their descriptions of the mandate, but they shrugged it off when asked about it. Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), the ringleader of the Senate Republicans attacking the mandate, said he thought firms with more than 100 employees ― the threshold for being subject to the requirement ― could not possibly handle testing their workforce every week. “I’ve talked to hundreds of business owners back home, and they think it’s almost impossible to do that,” Marshall told HuffPost. “It is a huge inconvenience.” Marshall added, “Frankly, some of those people don’t want to be tested, either.” Other Republicans also brushed off the testing option. “The government’s role is to just give us good information and let us make our own decision,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said. “Testing is expensive and it’s a burden,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) added. Some Republicans seemed unfamiliar with the testing alternative. “I hadn’t even heard of it,” Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) said, noting that he’d been spending “every waking minute” on a national defense authorization bill. Inhofe was one of the Republicans who signed a letter calling the vaccine requirement “immoral.” “My understanding is that there’s not necessarily an opt-out, but even so, I mean, nobody should have to go through like a daily, weekly, whatever testing protocol,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said. (Vaccine rules for federal workers and members of the armed forces don’t have the same testing options.) State Republican officials have sued to stop the OSHA rule from moving forward, and a federal court granted atemporary stayblocking it on the grounds it raises “grave” constitutional issues. The case will go before a panel of judges at the conservative-leaning U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, then possibly the Supreme Court. Even if the administration is successful, the litigation could push implementation of the vaccine-or-test deadline well beyond Jan. 4. It’s hard to say how most employers will respond to the testing piece of the rule, assuming the regulation survives. Some may be happy to implement a vaccine requirement as many large employers already have, using the OSHA rule as cover. Others may want to maintain the testing opt-out to prevent any vaccine resisters from leaving, so long as they find the testing workable. Jordan Barab, a work safety expert and former OSHA official, said he believes the testing option would be a viable one, assuming the price of tests comes down. From a public-health perspective, Barab would prefer that the OSHA rule did not have a testing hatch door at all. But if the opt-out is there, he argues that employers should have to bear the cost of testing, so that more of them choose to forgo it.

       " ('Headline: Southwest Airlines Pilot Told Passengers \\'Let\\'s Go Brandon\\' In Anti-Biden Dig: Reporter\\nDate: 2021-10-31\\nAuthor: Nina Golgowski\\nSummary: The phrase, which is a PG way of saying \"f**k Joe Biden,\" reportedly provoked audible gasps from some passengers.\\nArticle: ASouthwest Airlinespilot reportedly told passengers Friday over the plane’s intercom: “Let’s go Brandon” ― a code phrase that’sbeing usedto mean “f**kJoe Biden.” The phrase was announced to some audible gasps from passengers on the morning flight from Houston to Albuquerque, New Mexico, according to Associated Press reporter Colleen Long who said she was on the flight and heard the announcement. Long said sheunsuccessfully attemptedto get a comment from the pilot while still on the plane. The airline in a later statement told her that “behavior from any individual that is divisive or offensive is not condoned.” The phrase has become a PG way of insulting Biden after a NASCAR crowd was heard shouting “Fuck Joe Biden” at an event in early October. A reporter at the scene mistook the crowd as saying “Let’s go, Brandon,” in support of driver Brandon Brown after he won his first NASCAR Xfinity Series race. Friday’s incident may not have been the first time a pilot made such a declaration on a flight, as avideo posted to TikTokon Oct. 11 claims to have captured another Southwest Airlines pilot telling passengers “Let’s go Brandon” while welcoming them aboard. 💀💀💀 People who commented on the video, whose identities could not be independently verified by HuffPost, said they had similar experiences with Southwest, as well as Delta. A representative for Southwest Airlines told HuffPost in a statement Sunday that an internal investigation has been launched into the pilot’s reported behavior. The statement said that it does not condone its employees sharing their personal political opinions while on the job and that one employee’s opinion should not be taken as a representation for all of its employees. Biden’s impending COVID-19 vaccine mandate for federal workers, including airline employees, has created turmoil among Southwest Airline workers. The airline’s pilot union unsuccessfully sought a temporary restraining order against the mandate this month, claiming the vaccine could have medical side effects that could jeopardize a pilot’s career.

It later reversed this threat, saying it would work to help its vaccine-adverse workers get an “accommodation.” These decisions came amidwidespread flight disruptions, which the airline blamed on bad weather and air traffic control issues, though it’s been suggested the cancellations were related to pilots going on strike over Biden’s vaccine mandate.

       " (\"Headline: New York City To Let Unvaccinated Athletes Play Home Games\\nDate: 2022-03-24\\nAuthor: Michelle L. Price, AP\\nSummary: The city's vaccine mandate will still apply for workers in other jobs.\\nArticle: NEW YORK (AP) — New York City’s mayor will announce Thursday that he’s exempting athletes and performers from the city’s vaccine mandate for private workers, a move that will allow Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving to play home games and unvaccinated baseball players to take the field when their season begins. Mayor Eric Adams will make the announcement Thursday morning and it will be effective immediately, according to a person familiar with the upcoming announcement who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The city’s sweeping vaccine mandate for workers will still apply to people with other types of jobs, including government employees. Adams had said he felt the vaccine rule was unfair when it came to athletes and performers because a loophole in the measure, imposed under his predecessor, allowed visiting players and performers who don’t work in New York to still play or perform even if they are unvaccinated. Irving, a vaccine holdout, had been among the most high-profile people impacted. He was able tore-join the team in Januarybut only when they played out of town games. Irving and Nets coach Steve Nash said they didn’t want to comment until after an official announcement. Irving scored 43 points Wednesday night on his 30th birthday in a 132-120 loss in Memphis after scoring a career-high 60 on March 15 in Orlando in the last game he was eligible to play. The Nets need him as they push for a playoff spot with nine games left in their regular season. “It just turns the whole team around when he’s out there, so hopefully we get some good news,” Nets star Kevin Durant said. This month, concerns had been raised that the rule would also impact Major League Baseball. Yankees star Aaron Judgerefused to directly answer a question about his vaccine statusearlier this month, leading to speculation that another New York team would be hobbled by a player’s refusal to get inoculated. When asked Wednesday about a possible vaccine exemption, Judge said he was “happy Kyrie can play some home games.” “If the mandate is not there, it’s good for Kyrie,” Judge told The Associated Press during spring training in Tampa, Florida, adding he “wasn’t too worried” about the mandate’s effect on the Yankees. The Yankees, who open their season at home against the Boston Red Sox on April 7, said earlier this month that the team president was “working with city hall and all other appropriate officials on this matter.” The Yankees declined comment Wednesday. Adams, a Mets fan, is scheduled to make an “economic and health-related announcement” Thursday morning at Citi Field, where the Mets play, according to his official calendar that was released Wednesday night. Adams has beenrolling back vaccine mandates and other coronavirus restrictions, including on Tuesday when he said masks could become optional for children under 5 starting April 4. Mask mandates for older children have already been removed, as well as rulesrequiring people to show proof of vaccinationto dine in a restaurant, work out at a gym, attend a show, or go to an indoor sporting event. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio made vaccination mandatory as a workplace safety rule last year, before leaving office. All employers are supposed to bar unvaccinated workers from being in shared workplaces. The city suspended numerous public employees for refusing to get vaccinated, including public servants like firefighters and sanitation workers.

       " ('Headline: News Organizations Caught In Biden Limbo Along With Biden\\nDate: 2015-10-07\\nAuthor: Michael Calderone and Sam Stein\\nSummary: The vice president\\'s delay has fueled more intense media attention than he\\'s gotten during seven years in office.\\nArticle: NEW YORK -- “Will He Run? Biden Speculation Mounts.” ThatWall Street Journal headlineappeared on June 28, but it could be just as applicable this week as Vice President Joe Biden still is in the process of considering a third run for president, challenging Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and insurgent candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt). The summer Biden boomlet has stretched into fall as unnamed confidants, friends, advisers -- and apparently Biden himself -- provide fodder for journalists trying to advance the story. The biggest nugget came in that June 28 Journal story, which reported that Beau Biden urged his father to run for president before his death in May -- details attributed to “Biden friends and advisers.” This was followed by a Maureen Down column in the Times describing the scene in vivid detail. But Politico unleashed the latest torrent of speculation Tuesday with a different angle on the son’s dying wish. Edward-Isaac Doverereportedthat the vice president himself had told Dowd about Beau’s wish that he run -- an anecdote relayed without attribution inher Aug. 1 column. Politico framed the story as Biden having \"leaked\" his private exchange with Beau as a calculated move to anonymously advertise his intentions in pages of the Times. A more charitable characterization might be that Biden had a conversation with Dowd, telling a story about his son that he’d told others, and allowed her to use it without attribution. Biden’s office denounced the Politico story without commenting specifically on whether he spoke to Dowd. “The bottom line on the Politico story is that it is categorically false and the characterization is offensive,” a spokesperson said in a statement. Dowd did not return calls requesting comment as to how the interaction with her source played out. Regardless of who called who first, the Politico \"exclusive\" was just the latest course in a feeding frenzy of Biden news that -- even considered collectively -- hasn\\'t added up to all that much. The vice president remains, much like in June, on the edge of running. And being in that political limbo has given him the type of intense political coverage that basically has eluded his office for years. In February,CNNreported that Biden would make a decision \"by the end of the summer.\"U.S. News reported in June that adecision would come by the end of July. CNN reported that advisers had instructed him tochoose whether to runby the end of September. In August, the Associated Pressreported that a decision was coming aftera weeklong retreat with his family; two weeks later, the APreported that hewould make a decisionby Oct. 1. In September, the Wall Street Journal said a decision could come \"well into the fall.\" This week, CBS News reported that he couldcome down one way or anotherwithin seven to 10 days. At some point along the way, it became clear that things weren\\'t moving as quickly as envisioned, which promptedSalon to run a piecein late September titled \"What is Taking Joe Biden So Long?\" This week, the Washington Post\\'s Dana Milbanklampooned the\"never-ending\" Biden delay. Google the phrase \"Will he or won\\'t he,\" and you\\'ll find aWeekly Standard articleon Biden from April, aPolitico itemfrom August, anMSNBC segmentfrom a few weeks later and aWashington Post articlefrom October. The Post followed up that article Wednesday bypolling readersabout whether or not they think the VP will run. On Tuesday,CNN, MSNBC and Fox News all did segments onDovere’s piece, which itself came on the heels ofa separate \"exclusive\"from colleague Mike Allen Monday that Biden is expected to make a decision by next weekend. While Biden has spoken publicly about uncertainty about running and his grieving process, he’s given the press little by way of firm dates (which, of course, he may still not know). That’s forced journalists to turn to sources in or around the VP\\'s orbit, most of whom will only speak anonymously -- a “Democrat close to the process,” a “former Senate colleague,” a “longtime friend,\" in Allen’s case. Some “friends” evenexpressed their concernsabout Biden running to The New York Times in August, saying they were hesitant to do so directly to the vice president. And some Democratic senators channeled their concerns Wednesdaythrough CNN. The Washington Postconducted a Q&Awith its own reporter, Paul Kane, who has covered Biden over the years, to glean whatever insights he might have. News outlets have been placed in a difficult position: fearful of missing a major campaign development but forced, in a way, to cover a candidate who doesn\\'t exist. Many have declined to assign someone permanently to the story. Still, a nascent Biden beat has developed in recent months, largely comprised of reporters who reported on him as a senator, a candidate in 2008 and 2012 or are currently tasked with covering the White House. TheLos Angeles Times’ Mike Memoli and ABC News’ Arlette Saenz, who covered Biden as campaigns embeds in 2008 and 2012 respectively, are among the Washington reporters covering any news developments or public appearances. Associated Press White House reporter Josh Lederman has been covering Biden 2016 news at his organization. Several New York Times reporters across the politics and White House desks -- including Maggie Haberman, Jonathan Martin, Amy Chozick, Carl Hulse, Jason Horowitz, and Peter Baker -- have contributed to the paper\\'s Biden 2016 coverage in recent months.Though The Times has not assigned anyone to Biden full-time, political editor Carolyn Ryan said in an email that “we are discussing how to cover him when and if he gets in.” The Huffington Post hasn’t assigned anyone to the Biden beat, either, but didreport on July 18that he was still considering a run. The Journal’s Colleen Nelson and Peter Nicholas, who wrote the aforementioned June 28 article, along with White House reporter Carol Lee, have all covered the Biden buzz in recent months (and years!). Dovere, a White House reporter whocleverly broke the detailsof Biden’s emotional interview with Late Show host Stephen Colbert by attending the show in person, has taken the lead on the Biden 2016 beat, according to editor Susan Glasser.
